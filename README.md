# 5-day-Generative-AI-Intensive
ðŸŽ’ Day-1â€™s Assignments

ðŸ’¡What Youâ€™ll Learn

Today youâ€™ll explore the evolution of LLMs, from transformers to techniques like fine-tuning and inference acceleration. Youâ€™ll also get trained in the art of prompt engineering for optimal LLM interaction.

The code lab will walk you through getting started with the Gemini API and cover several prompt techniques and how different parameters impact the prompts.

ðŸŽ’ Day-2â€™s Assignments

ðŸ’¡ What Youâ€™ll Learn

Today you will learn about the conceptual underpinning of embeddings and vector databases and how they can be used to bring live or specialist data into your LLM application. Youâ€™ll also explore their geometrical powers for classifying and comparing textual data. 

ðŸŽ’ Day-3â€™s Assignments

ðŸ’¡ What Youâ€™ll Learn

Learn to build sophisticated AI agents by understanding their core components and the iterative development process.

The code labs cover how to connect LLMs to existing systems and to the real world. Learn about function calling by giving SQL tools to a chatbot, and learn how to build a LangGraph agent that takes orders in a cafÃ©.

ðŸŽ’ Day-4â€™s Assignment

ðŸ’¡ What Youâ€™ll Learn

In todayâ€™s reading, youâ€™ll delve into the creation and application of specialized LLMs like SecLM and MedLM/Med-PaLM, with insights from the researchers who built them.

In the code labs you will learn how to add real world data to a model beyond its knowledge cut-off by grounding with Google Search.  You will also learn how to fine-tune a custom Gemini model using your own labeled data to solve custom tasks.

ðŸŽ’ Final Assignment

ðŸ’¡ What Youâ€™ll Learn

Discover how to adapt MLOps practices for Generative AI and leverage Vertex AI's tools for foundation models and generative AI applications.
